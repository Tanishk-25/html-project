
Regex
as a xase study we are using the regex and our scraoing target is book titles and prices form a summy websites
basic req are:
latest version of python you can use ide anaconda or idle
beautiful soup 4 library to prase html web page
req library to make html req

Install the requ libraries 
reques is a libraru responsible for sending req to the websites on the internet and returning their response
Install req library using command

Pip install req

Beautiful soup is a module used to parse and extract data from the html response. Inatall beautiful soup using ccommand
pip install beautifulsoup4

Note re is a built in package in python which is used for working with regular expressions create a file and name it weScrappingRegex.py
Step 1: import the required packages ot libraries

import requests 
form bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

Step 2:
with the help of req library send a req to a web page from which you want to scrape or extract the data
the ur; we are isong dor demo purpose is : https://books.torscrape.com/
page = req.get("https://toscrape.com"/
Step 3 selecting the data

for this create a beautiful soup object and pass content recieved from your req during the initialization
include the parser tupe to work with an html code select html.pparser as the parser tyoe
right click and select inspect element in a browser you can see that each book title and price are presented inside and article element with the class called product_pod 
use beatiful Soup to get all the data inside these ekements and then convert it to a string

sp = beautifulSoup (page.content, "html.parser")
content - sp,find_all(class_-"product_pod")
content = str(content)

Step 4 Data processing using regex
You can see while printing content using print (content) it has a lot of unnecessary data, so 
Create two regular expression sto get only desired data 
Print(content) will give us raw data as:

[<article class= "product_pod">
<div class- :image_container">
<a href = "catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html"><img alt = "A light in the Attic" class - "thumbnail"
src = "media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67
</div>
<p class = "star-rating three">
<i class = "icon-star"></i>
<i class = "icon-star"></i>
<i class = "icon-star"></i>
<i class = "icon-star"></i>
<i class = "icon-star"></i>

</p>
<h3> <a href = "catalogue/a-light-in-hte-attic_100/index.html" title = :a light in the attic"> a light in the ...</a> </h4>
<div class = product_price">
<p class = "instock availability">
<i class - "icon-ok"></i>
	in stock
</p>

expression 1 
fint the pattern 
firstly inspect the title of the book to find the pattern you can see in the raw data abovee that every title is present after the text tille = in the format title = :titlename"
now generste the expression:
Create and expressuons that returns the daya inside ide equations after the tite = by specifying "(.*/"
the first expressions is as follows:
regex_ title = r'title="(.*?)">")"

expressions 2 :
fint the pattern 
firstly inspect the price of the book you can see in the raw data that every price is present the text E in the format E = price before the paragraph tag</p>
Now generate the expression:
Create an expresssion that returns the data inside quptations after the E = and before the </p>
by specifying E(.*?>
regex_price = "E(.*?)"</p>
at the end use the expression swith re .findall to find the substring matching the patterns and save them in the variables titleList and priceList 
TitleList = re.findall(regex_title, content)
priceList=re.findall(regex_prices, content)

Step 5: Save the output in aa file
